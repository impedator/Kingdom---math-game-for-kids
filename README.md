# Kingdom - math game for kids

Script generates PDF file with table filled by random digits.

The players take turns to group cells giving a sum of 10 in such a way that the marked fields are connected with each other on the sides (not at the corners). Each cell can only be used once.
⠀
The goal of the game is to get as much of the circled area in your color as possible. If a player has several areas, he takes the largest area into account when finally counting the results.
⠀
We play until it is not possible to mark the sum 10. Then the players count the selected cells and the winner is the one who has the most of them.
